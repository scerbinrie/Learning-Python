print "Hello Barny!"
print "Please think of a number between 0-100."
print "Got it?"
print "Good."

print "Ok, first question is the number greater than or equal or less than 50"    ''' <--- hmm, there are three implied quetions in this. 

While you could make a program that worked to this kind of questioning, the response provided by the user could be many, so you would have to
code an interpreter of the responses or limit the scope of the user's responses. For example I could say "bigger" or "greater" or "smaller" 
or "lesser" or "less".

For the purposes of simplicity, narrow the scope and modify the language so that the user would have to response "Yes" or "No". 

For example: "Is the number greater than or equal to 50 (Yes/No)?"   

Doing it this way makes the binary tree decision also a lot simpler to conceptualize.
